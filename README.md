### Operating Systems : 
**This course provides an in-depth exploration of the design and implementation of modern operating systems. It covers the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie the functioning of operating systems, including process management, memory management, file systems, and input/output systems.

Students will learn about process synchronization, inter-process communication, and the mechanisms of deadlock handling. The course also delves into the management of system resources, including CPU scheduling, memory allocation, and disk management. Additionally, the course examines the security and protection mechanisms within operating systems, providing an understanding of how operating systems safeguard data and manage user access.

Through hands-on projects and case studies, students will gain practical experience in working with operating systems, enhancing their understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of OS design. By the end of the course, students will be well-equipped to understand the inner workings of operating systems and apply this knowledge to real-world computing environments.

Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of computer architecture and programming.

Learning Outcomes:

. Understand the core functions and components of operating systems.
. Develop skills in process and memory management.
. Gain insights into file system implementation and management.
. Learn about the mechanisms of process synchronization and deadlock handling.
. Understand the security features and protection mechanisms within operating systems.
. Apply OS concepts through practical projects and case studies.**
